# Blockchain

A basic Python implementation of a blockchain to demonstrate core concepts like:

- Block creation
- Proof-of-Work
- Transaction handling
- Node registration
- Consensus algorithm

## Features

- Create and mine blocks (`/mine`)
- Add new transactions (`/transactions/new`)
- View the full chain (`/chain`)
- Register other nodes in the network (`/nodes/register`)
- Resolve conflicts and achieve consensus (`/nodes/resolve`)

> Use cURL or Postman for testing.

## Dependency

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
